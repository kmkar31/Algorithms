# KdTree

## Implement a K-D-Tree structure to find out all points within a rectangular area of interest and also find the closest point to the point of interest given a set of points.

## Implementation

<h3> PointSET.java :</h3> Uses a <b>Red-Black BST</b> for the above implementation.
<h3> KdTree.java :</h3> Uses a <b>K-D-Tree</b> implementation.
<h3> KdTreeVisualizer.java:</h3> Creates a K-D-Tree from a set of points placed on a canvas.
<h3>KdTreeGenerator.java :</h3> Creates n random points in the unit square and print to standard output.
<h3>RangeSearchVisualizer.java :</h3> 
Reads points from a file (specified as a command-line argument) and draws to standard draw. It also draws all of the points in the rectangle the user selects by dragging the mouse.
The range search results using the brute-force algorithm are drawn in red; the results using the K-D-Tree algorithms are drawn in blue.
<h3>NearestNeighborVisualizer.java :</h3> 
Reads points from a file (specified as a command-line argument) and draws to standard draw. Highlights the closest point to the mouse.
The nearest neighbor according to the brute-force algorithm is drawn in red; the nearest neighbor using the K-D-Tree algorithm is drawn in blue.
